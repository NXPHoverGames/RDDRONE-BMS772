## Disclaimer - CAUTION WARNING
### CAUTION - WARNING
Lithium and other batteries are dangerous and must be treated with care. 
Rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries are potentially hazardous and can present a serious FIRE HAZARD if damaged, defective or improperly used. Larger Lithium batteries and those used for industrial use involving high discharge current and frequent full discharge cycles require special precautions.

Do not connect this BMS to a lithium ion battery without expertise and  training in handling and use of batteries of this type.
Use appropriate test equipment and safety protocols during development.

This readme files will explain how to get the right nuttx and nuttx-apps repository with the BMS5.0 patches and build the BMS software (create a binary file).
This will work best on a linux machine, you could use a virtual machine for it.

See this webpage for the NuttX quickstart guide: https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/quickstart/quickstart.html.

## Dependencies
git
unzip
curl

## Make sure git is installed
If git is not installed, open a terminal and type the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

## Get the incubator nuttx and apps
Make a usefull folder to place the files in, like drones.
```bash
mkdir -p drones
```
```bash
cd drones
```

Clone the nuttx and nuttx apps git repositories.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx.git nuttx
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx-apps.git apps
```
## Checkout the right commit
In the apps directory, checkout the right commit and branch.
```bash
(cd apps; git checkout nuttx-10.0.0 -b bms772)
```
## Get the BMS in the nuttx-apps
Make a nxp_bms folder in the apps and the BMS_v1 folder in that folder
```bash
mkdir -p apps/nxp_bms
```
Clone this repository in that folder
```bash
(cd apps/nxp_bms; git clone https://github.com/NXPHoverGames/RDDRONE-BMS772.git BMS_v1)
```
Checkout the public regulated data types.
```bash
(cd apps/nxp_bms/BMS_v1; git clone https://github.com/px4/public_regulated_data_types; cd public_regulated_data_types; git checkout 78b883891a582ff0eb41375433247b5ca0d44d21)
```
## Apply the patches
Apply the patch to the nuttx-apps.
```bash
(cd apps; patch -p1 < nxp_bms/BMS_v1/Patchfiles/0001-apps-patch-BMS5.0.patch)
```
Go the nuttx folder and checkout the right NuttX commit.
```bash
cd nuttx
```
```bash
git checkout 5c3ce49d8240a13899fb5a9d93b70c50140fcd41 -b bms772
```
Add the nuttx patch.
```bash
patch -p1 < ../apps/nxp_bms/BMS_v1/Patchfiles/0001-nuttx-patch-BMS5.0.patch
```
## Install the Kconfig tools and the crosscompiler if needed
When this is your first NuttX project, you need to install the Kconfig tools and the cross compiler. Otherwise you can skip this part and continue with "configure and make the binary".
### Install the Kconfig tools if needed
Install the build essentials and everything that is needed.
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install flex
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install bison
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install gperf
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```
Go back from the nuttx directory and make a tools directory next to it.
```bash
cd ..
```
```bash
mkdir -p tools
```
```bash
cd tools
```
Clone the nuttx tools master.
```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/tools/src/master
```
```bash
cd master
```
Apply the patch.
```bash
patch -p1 < ../../apps/nxp_bms/BMS_v1/Patchfiles/0001-aclocal-fix.patch
```
Configure and install it.
```bash
cd kconfig-frontends
```
```bash
./configure --enable-mconf --disable-nconf --disable-gconf --disable-qconf
```
```bash
make
```
```bash
sudo make install
```
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```
Go back to the nuttx directory
```bash
cd ../../../nuttx
```
### Install the cross compiler if needed 
If not already installed, install the cross compiler with the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

## Configure and make the binary
Configure the BMS.
For normal use:
```bash
tools/configure.sh -e rddrone-bms772:bms
```
For debug purposes:
```bash
tools/configure.sh -e rddrone-bms772:bmsdebug
```

Make the binary with: 
```bash
make
```
## Using the command line interface (CLI) of the BMS
Make sure the BMS is powered and everything is connected properly to the BMS.

Use a UART terminal like minicom on a linux machine or PuTTY or teraTerm on a windows machine and connect to the right COM port.
The settings are:
*   115200 Baud
*   8 data bits
*   1 stop bit

## Programming the BMS with the JLink debugger
See the release notes of the BMS772 how to attach the debugger.

To program the BMS using a JLink debugger you need to have JLink installed.
Make sure the BMS is powered.

Open a terminal where the nuttx.bin file is located (probably in the nuttx folder).
Open JLink:
```bash
JLinkExe
```
Connect to it:
```bash
connect
```
Enter the correct device:
```bash
S32K144
```
Program it using SWD:
```bash
s
```
Use 1000kHz as target interface speed:
```bash
1000
```
Reset the device:
```bash
r
```
Reset the entire flash by sending these commands:
```bash
w1 0x40020007, 0x44     
```
```bash
w1 0x40020000, 0x80    
```
Load the nuttx binary at address 0
```bash
loadbin nuttx.bin 0
```
Reset the device
```bash
r
```
Run the program
```bash
g
```
Quit the JLinkExe 
```bash
q
```
